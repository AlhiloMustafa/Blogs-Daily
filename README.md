# Blogs-Daily

## Task
Build full web-app using templating; it is very minimalistic and mostly focused on Node.js (EJS, Express and body-parser).

## Requirement 
1-	The web-app has a header Nave Bar included (Home, About me, and My Contacts page) and footer. The pages generated using EJS particles
2-	Home page will include some blogs that truncated into less than 100 characters instead of whole blog. But when click on it, it should take you to the blog individual page. 
3-	A Hidden page to create the individual blog. 

## Run locally (Please feel free to download it and use it )
1-	Run this command “git clone https://github.com/AlhiloMustafa/Blogs-Daily.git”
2-	Run npm install; you will see the node_modules add to your directory
3-	Run the app.js 
4-	Now the web-app running; you can use the code and play round

## Summary 
I hope this project can help new web developers to build their own website with node.js., it helps to understand:
1-	What the node.js directory structure
2-	Rendered the text dynamically using EJS
3-	Understand EJS layout and partials 
4-	Routing in nod.js and paths
